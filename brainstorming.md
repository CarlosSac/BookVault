## Favorite Existing Apps - Categorize and Evaluate


### Tractive

* **Category:** Lifestyle / Navigation / Health (Pet Wellness)
* **Mobile:** Essential. The mobile app is the primary interface for the Tractive GPS hardware device attached to the pet. It uses mobile data/GPS for real-time location tracking on a map, allows setting and receiving virtual fence alerts (geofencing).
* **Story:** Provides peace of mind to pet owners by allowing them to know where their cat or dog is at all times, find them if they get lost, and monitor their activity levels and sleep patterns for potential health insights.
* **Market:** Pet owners concerned about their pets getting lost or interested in monitoring their pet's activity and wellness. 
* **Habit:** Users check the app when their pet is outside, if they receive an alert (e.g., pet leaves safe zone), or periodically to check location or review activity/sleep data. Push notifications drive interaction. Usage might increase if a pet goes missing.
* **Scope:** Core functionality is live GPS tracking and virtual fences.

### Shop

* **Category:** Shopping / Productivity
* **Mobile:** Mobile-first experience. Essential for receiving real-time push notifications about order shipments and deliveries. 
* **Story:** Streamlines the online shopping experience by consolidating package tracking in one place and offering a curated discovery platform for brands, making it easier to manage orders and find new products to buy.
* **Market:** Online shoppers, particularly those who frequently purchase from stores using the Shopify platform, and anyone wanting a unified package tracking solution.
* **Habit:** Users open the app frequently when expecting deliveries to check status updates. May also browse recommended products or followed stores periodically.
* **Scope:** Expanded scope includes becoming a mobile shopping marketplace, integrating Shop Pay accelerated checkout, managing buy-now-pay-later installments.

### Ruler

* **Category:** Utilities
* **Mobile:** Exclusively mobile. It requires the device's camera and motion sensors to function, using Augmented Reality (AR) to overlay measurements onto the real world.
* **Story:** Offers the convenience of a basic measuring tool directly on your iPhone or iPad, useful for quick estimations when a physical tape measure isn't handy.
* **Market:** Anyone needing occasional, approximate measurements of real-world objects (furniture dimensions, picture spacing, etc.). Not designed for tasks requiring high precision.
* **Habit:** Situational use. Users open the app only when they have a specific, immediate need to measure something. Not typically used daily or habitually.
* **Scope:** Initially offered basic point-to-point AR measurement. Scope expanded in subsequent iOS updates to include automatic measurement of rectangular objects, measuring a person's height (on devices with LiDAR), saving measurements with photos, and incorporating a digital spirit level function.
